**REQ-1.4.3**: The system SHALL support models up to 26GB in size.

### 1.5 Intelligent Routing

**REQ-1.5.1**: The regional router SHALL score each GPU instance using:
- 50% weight: Queue depth (least connections)
- 30% weight: Network latency

**REQ-1.5.3**: In disaster scenarios, the router SHALL automatically route to next-best region with latency increase <= 80ms.

**REQ-1.5.4**: The router SHALL maintain routing decisions in < 15ms.

### 1.6 Auto-scaling

**REQ-1.6.1**: The system SHALL auto-scale based on requests per second (RPS) with target of 1.0-1.5 RPS per instance.

**REQ-1.6.2**: The system SHALL scale up when average RPS exceeds target for 2 consecutive minutes.

**REQ-1.6.3**: The system SHALL scale down when average RPS is below target for 10 consecutive minutes.

**REQ-1.6.4**: The system SHALL enforce per-model-pool scaling policies:
- model-a: min=2, max=20 instances
- model-b: min=2, max=15 instances
- model-c: min=1, max=10 instances

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Performance

**REQ-2.1.1**: The system SHALL support sustained capacity:

- Peak (150 instances): 150-225 RPS

**REQ-2.1.2**: The system SHALL maintain P95 inference latency < 2 seconds under normal load.

**REQ-2.1.3**: The system SHALL handle burst traffic of 2-3x sustained capacity for up to 60 seconds.

### 2.2 Availability

**REQ-2.2.1**: The system SHALL provide 99.99% availability (4.3 minutes downtime/month).

**REQ-2.2.2**: The system SHALL survive complete failure of one AWS region with:
- Automatic failover in < 60 seconds
- Capacity reduction to 50-70%
- Latency increase of 15-80ms for affected users

### 2.3 Security

**REQ-2.3.1**: The system SHALL comply with:
- SOC 2 Type II
- HIPAA
- PCI DSS Level 1
- GDPR

**REQ-2.3.2**: The system SHALL use hardware-enforced memory encryption for all tenant data in Nitro Enclaves.

**REQ-2.3.3**: The system SHALL securely wipe all instance memory before reuse with validation checks.

**REQ-2.3.4**: The system SHALL quarantine instances that fail cleanup validation (MUST NOT reuse).

**REQ-2.3.5**: The system SHALL maintain audit logs of all:
- Encryption/decryption operations
- Instance lifecycle events
- Routing decisions
- Security validations

### 2.4 Scalability

**REQ-2.4.1**: The system SHALL support up to 200 GPU instances per region (600 total).

**REQ-2.4.2**: The system SHALL add new regions with < 2 weeks effort.

**REQ-2.4.3**: The system SHALL support model sizes from 1GB to 26GB without architectural changes.

### 2.5 Maintainability
